# raghavdhabe_spider_task1
This is my first spider task

1. App Dev Project: 
So there were 2 options to do this project, either use flutter or react native and make an app, or make a website. I chose to make a website for this task. Quite a basic layout actually,
there is an arrow, that starts with pointing to the right, rotates to the left 180 degrees, and goes back to original position, for an infinite amount of time, unless you stop it by pressing the spacebar. The score of the game is linearly dependent on how close the arrow is to 90 degrees, or a right angle, and this is shown visually with a black dot going up in the middle of the score bar. 

2. Networking Task: 
Well for this, theres not much of a readme required, there were questions and I answered them. Most were solved using statistics -> conversations, using some filters like tcp.port == 8000, and all. Only question which was somewhat diffucult to understand and do was the 8th qns in this task. You may see the answer

3. ML: 
Created a ResNet18 model, trained it using the given dataset(which was imported using opendatasets), divided dataset into testing and training.
While training, the training loss is also printed. And after this, in the next cell, the model was evaluated on testing data, and displayed the final accuracy and loss.
