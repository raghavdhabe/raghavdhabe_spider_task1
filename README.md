# raghavdhabe_spider_task1
This is my first spider task

1. App Dev Project
Well, I did git commit before git add in my working directory and I accidentally deleted all the subfolders, files, everything. And I tragically did not have the copy  of this either. So I will upload this soon

2. Networking Task
Well for this, theres not much of a readme required, there were questions and I answered them. Most were solved using statistics -> conversations, using some filters like tcp.port == 8000, and all. Only question which was somewhat diffucult to understand and do was the 8th qns in this task. You may see me answer

3. ML
Created a ResNet18 model, trained it using the given dataset(which was imported using opendatasets), divided dataset into testing and training. Final accuracy comes out to be 97-98%+ consistently.
